The "Blue Book for Bulldozers" dataset on Kaggle is a simplified version of the original book's data. It contains historical sales information for bulldozers and aims to predict their sale prices. The dataset includes various numerical and categorical features. The objective is to build regression models that estimate the value of used bulldozers. The dataset poses challenges such as missing data and categorical variable handling. The evaluation metric used is the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). Overall, it offers an opportunity to work on a real-world regression problem and gain practical experience in data preprocessing and regression modeling techniques.
